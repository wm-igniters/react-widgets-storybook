# Token Reference Table

This table lists all tokens for this component:

| Token | Description |
|-------|------------|
| height | Controls how tall progress bars appear (loading indicators that show completion percentage). This determines the vertical size of the progress bar track.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-height |
| radius | Controls the corner rounding of progress bars (loading indicators). This makes the progress bars appear with rounded corners instead of sharp edges for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-radius |
| margin | Controls the outer spacing around progress bars (the space between the progress bar and surrounding elements). This creates breathing room around the loading indicator.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-margin |
| transition.time | Controls how long progress bar animations take to complete (the smooth movement of the progress indicator). Shorter values make animations faster, longer values make them slower.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-transition-time |
| stroke.inactive | Sets the background color of progress bars (the empty/unfilled portion of the loading indicator). This is the color of the track that shows the remaining progress.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-stroke-inactive |
| stroke.active | Sets the fill color of progress bars (the filled portion of the loading indicator). This is the color that shows the completed progress.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-stroke-active |
| label.color | Sets the text color of progress bar labels (the percentage or text that appears on the progress bar). This should contrast well with the progress bar colors for readability.<br>CSS variable: --wm-progress-bar-label-color |

# Token Reference Table

This table lists all tokens for this component:

| Token | Description |
|-------|------------|
| background | Sets the background color of notification badges (small circular or pill-shaped elements that show numbers or status indicators). This is typically a bright color like red to grab attention.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-background |
| color | Sets the text color of notification badges (the color of the numbers or text inside the badge). This should contrast well with the background color for readability.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-color |
| min-height | Controls the minimum height of notification badges to ensure they're always tall enough to be visible and clickable, even when they contain small numbers or text.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-min-height |
| inline.padding | Controls the left and right spacing inside notification badges (the horizontal padding). This creates breathing room around the badge content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-inline-padding |
| block.padding | Controls the top and bottom spacing inside notification badges (the vertical padding). This creates breathing room above and below the badge content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-block-padding |
| radius | Controls the corner rounding of notification badges. Larger values make badges more pill-shaped, smaller values make them more rectangular.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-radius |
| font-family | Sets the typeface (font style) for notification badge text. This determines whether the badge numbers/text appear in Arial, Times New Roman, or other font styles.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-font-family |
| font-size | Controls how large the text appears in notification badges. Since badges are small, this is typically a small font size to fit the compact space.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-font-size |
| font-weight | Controls how thick or bold the badge text appears. Higher values (like 700) make the text thicker and more prominent, which helps badge numbers stand out.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-font-weight |
| line-height | Controls the vertical spacing between lines in badge text. A value of 1 keeps lines close together, which is ideal for small badge content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-line-height |
| letter-spacing | Controls the horizontal spacing between individual letters in badge text. This can help make small badge text more readable.<br>CSS variable: --wm-badge-letter-spacing |

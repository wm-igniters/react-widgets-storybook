# Token Reference Table

This table lists all tokens for this component:

| Token | Description |
|-------|------------|
| height | Controls how tall page footers appear (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). 'auto' lets the footer size itself based on its content, while specific values (px, %, em, rem, vh) set a fixed height.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-height |
| background | Sets the background color of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This is the main background color that appears behind the footer content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-background |
| color.@ | Sets the default text color of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This determines what color the footer text appears in, which should contrast well with the background for readability.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-color |
| color.muted | Sets the muted text color of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This is used for secondary or less important text in the footer, making it appear more subtle.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-color-muted |
| border.color | Sets the border color of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This creates the outline that defines the footer boundaries.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-border-color |
| border.style | Controls the border style of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). 'solid' creates a continuous line, 'dashed' creates a broken line, 'dotted' creates a dotted line, and 'none' removes the border.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-border-style |
| border.width | Controls the border width of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This determines how thick the footer border appears.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-border-width |
| border.radius | Controls the corner rounding of page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This makes the footer appear with rounded corners for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-border-radius |
| shadow | Controls the drop shadow effect around page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This creates a subtle shadow that makes the footer appear to float above the background, giving it depth and elevation.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-shadow |
| padding | Controls the internal spacing inside page footers (the bottom sections of web pages that contain copyright, links, and other information). This creates breathing room around the footer content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-footer-padding |

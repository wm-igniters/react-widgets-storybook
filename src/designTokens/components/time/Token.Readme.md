# Token Reference Table

This table lists all tokens for this component:

| Token | Description |
|-------|------------|
| input.font-family | Sets the typeface (font style) for time picker input fields (where users enter hours, minutes, and seconds). This determines whether the time values appear in Arial, Times New Roman, or other font styles.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-font-family |
| input.font-size | Controls how large the time values appear in time picker input fields (where users enter hours, minutes, and seconds). This affects the size of the time numbers that users see and interact with.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-font-size |
| input.font-weight | Controls how thick or bold the time values appear in time picker input fields. 'normal' makes it regular weight, 'bold' makes it thicker, and numbers (100-900) provide fine control over thickness.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-font-weight |
| input.line-height | Controls the vertical spacing between lines when time picker input text wraps to multiple lines. This ensures proper spacing for time values displayed in the input fields.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-line-height |
| input.letter-spacing | Controls the horizontal spacing between individual characters in time picker input fields. This can help make time values more readable and properly spaced.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-letter-spacing |
| input.width | Controls how wide time picker input fields appear (the boxes where users enter hours, minutes, and seconds). This determines the horizontal space available for time values.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-width |
| input.padding | Controls the internal spacing inside time picker input fields (the space between the time values and the field borders). This creates breathing room around the time numbers.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-padding |
| input.border.width | Controls the thickness of the border around time picker input fields. This creates a bottom border to separate the time input from other elements.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-border-width |
| input.border.style | Controls the style of the border around time picker input fields. 'solid' creates a continuous line, 'dashed' creates a dotted line, 'dotted' creates small dots, 'none' removes the border.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-border-style |
| input.border.color | Sets the color of the border around time picker input fields. This determines the color of the outline that defines the time input area.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-border-color |
| input.border.radius | Controls the corner rounding of time picker input fields. When set to 'none', the fields have sharp corners. Higher values create more rounded corners for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-input-border-radius |
| background | Sets the background color of time picker components (the dropdown panel that appears when users click to select time). This is the main background color that appears behind the time selection interface.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-background |
| border.radius | Controls the corner rounding of time picker components (the dropdown panel that appears when users click to select time). This makes the time picker appear with rounded corners for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-border-radius |
| padding | Controls the internal spacing inside time picker components (the space between the time selection interface and the panel borders). This creates breathing room around the time selection controls.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-padding |
| period.selector.border.@ | Controls the border styling of time picker period selectors (AM/PM buttons that users click to choose morning or afternoon time). This creates the outline that defines the period selector buttons.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-border |
| period.selector.border.radius | Controls the corner rounding of time picker period selectors (AM/PM buttons). This makes the period selector buttons appear with rounded corners for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-border-radius |
| period.selector.background | Sets the background color of time picker period selectors (AM/PM buttons that users click to choose morning or afternoon time). This is the main background color that appears behind the period selector buttons.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-background |
| period.selector.color | Sets the text color of time picker period selectors (the AM/PM text that appears on the period selector buttons). This should contrast well with the background for readability.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-color |
| period.selector.font-family | Sets the typeface (font style) for time picker period selectors (the AM/PM text). This determines whether the period text appears in Arial, Times New Roman, or other font styles.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-font-family |
| period.selector.font-size | Controls how large the period selector text appears (the AM/PM text). This affects the size of the period text that users see and interact with.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-font-size |
| period.selector.font-weight | Controls how thick or bold the period selector text appears (the AM/PM text). 'normal' makes it regular weight, 'bold' makes it thicker, and numbers (100-900) provide fine control over thickness.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-font-weight |
| period.selector.line-height | Controls the vertical spacing between lines when period selector text wraps to multiple lines. This ensures proper spacing for the AM/PM text displayed on the buttons.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-line-height |
| period.selector.letter-spacing | Controls the horizontal spacing between individual characters in period selector text (the AM/PM text). This can help make the period text more readable and properly spaced.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-period-selector-letter-spacing |
| btn.padding | Controls the internal spacing inside time picker buttons (the space between the button content and its border). This creates breathing room around the button text and icons.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-padding |
| btn.border.radius | Controls the corner rounding of time picker buttons (navigation and control buttons in the time picker interface). This makes the buttons appear with rounded corners for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-border-radius |
| btn.border.color | Sets the color of the border around time picker buttons. This determines the color of the outline that defines the button shape.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-border-color |
| btn.border.style | Controls the style of the border around time picker buttons. 'solid' creates a continuous line, 'dashed' creates a dotted line, 'dotted' creates small dots, 'none' removes the border.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-border-style |
| btn.border.width | Controls the thickness of the border around time picker buttons. When set to 0, there's no visible border. Higher values create thicker borders around the buttons.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-border-width |
| btn.background | Sets the background color of time picker buttons. When set to 'transparent', the buttons have no background color, making them transparent.<br>CSS variable: --wm-timepicker-btn-background |

# Callback Events

Currently, there are no documented events specifically for the Menu component. The component likely relies on standard DOM events like click, focus, blur, etc., which can be handled through conventional event listeners.

## Standard DOM Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| click | Triggered when a menu item is clicked |
| mouseover | Triggered when the mouse cursor moves over the menu or its items |
| mouseout | Triggered when the mouse cursor leaves the menu or its items |
| focus | Triggered when the menu or an item receives focus |
| blur | Triggered when the menu or an item loses focus |

# Callback Events

Typical popover components would include the following events, though specific events aren't defined in the provided data:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onOpen` | Triggered when the popover is displayed |
| `onClose` | Triggered when the popover is hidden |
| `onClickOutside` | Triggered when a user clicks outside the popover boundary |
| `onEscapeKeyDown` | Triggered when the escape key is pressed while the popover is open |
| `onPositionChange` | Fired when the calculated position of the popover changes |

These events allow for custom behaviors when users interact with the popover component.

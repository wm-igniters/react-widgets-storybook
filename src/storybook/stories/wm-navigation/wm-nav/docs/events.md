# Callback Events

The Nav component doesn't have any pre-defined callback events listed in the component data. Typically, navigation interactions would be handled through the `itemaction` property, which allows you to define custom actions when navigation items are clicked.

### Custom Event Handling

While there are no formal event handlers defined for this component, you can implement custom event handling using the following approaches:

1. Using the `itemaction` property to define click behaviors
2. Adding event listeners programmatically to the rendered navigation elements
3. Implementing navigation state changes through bound variables

For specific interaction needs beyond the built-in functionality, consider extending the component with custom JavaScript handlers.

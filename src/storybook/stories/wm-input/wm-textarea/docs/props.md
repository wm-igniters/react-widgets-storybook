        | `name` | string | - | A unique identifier for the textarea component. Special characters and spaces are not allowed. |
        | `placeholder` | - | "Place your text" | A placeholder is text to show in the editor when there is no value. A common use of this is a search box that says in faint gray italicized text "Search..." which disappears as soon as the user starts to edit the text box. This is a useful alternative to a caption if you are constrained in space and asking for something simple of the user. |

  <summary>Behavior</summary>
    <div>
        | Property | Type | Default | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `autofocus` | boolean | false | This property makes the element get focused automatically when the page loads. |
        | `readonly` | boolean | false | This property prevents the user from being able to change the data value of a component. It is a bindable property. |
        | `show` | boolean | true | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
        | `loadOnDemand` | boolean | false | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the component will be deferred till the component becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the component through script until the component is initialized). When show property is not bound the component will be initialized immediately. |
        | `disabled` | boolean | false | If the disabled property is true (checked) the component becomes display-only and user input will not be accepted. It can also set programmatically by binding it to a boolean type variable. |
        | `autotrim` | boolean | true | Automatically removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input value. |
        | `updateon` | string | "blur" | If the selected value is **blur**: datavalue will be updated on blur event, **keypress**: datavalue will be updated on keypress. |
        | `updatedelay` | number | 0 | The amount of delay in milliseconds to update the datavalue. |

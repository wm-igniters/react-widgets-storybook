# Styling

The Textarea component supports styling through the standard mobile styling system. While specific CSS classes aren't directly used as in web applications, you can apply styling through the Style tab in the Properties panel.

## Common Style Properties

- **Text Properties**: Font family, size, weight, color, and alignment
- **Background**: Background color
- **Border**: Border color, width, and radius
- **Dimensions**: Custom width and height
- **Padding**: Internal spacing within the textarea
- **Margin**: External spacing around the textarea

## States

You can apply different styles to the textarea based on its state:

- **Normal**: Default appearance
- **Focus**: When the textarea has input focus
- **Disabled**: When the textarea is disabled
- **Read-only**: When the textarea is in read-only mode

## Customization

For more advanced styling needs, you can use custom classes and apply them to the textarea through the Classes property in the Style tab.

The container of the textarea can also be styled separately from the input area itself, allowing for effects like drop shadows, custom borders, or background effects.

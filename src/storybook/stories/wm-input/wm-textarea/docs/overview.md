# Overview

The Textarea component is a multi-line plain-text editing control that allows users to input large amounts of text. Unlike single-line text input fields, Textarea provides a larger space for entering and editing text, making it ideal for collecting comments, feedback, descriptions, or any other form of longer text input in your mobile application.

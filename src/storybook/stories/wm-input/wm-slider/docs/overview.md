# Overview

The Slider component is a user interface control that allows users to select a value or range from a continuous set of values by moving a thumb along a track. It is particularly useful for settings that have a minimum and maximum value like volume, brightness, or price ranges.

Sliders provide an intuitive way for users to make numeric selections when the precise value is less important than the relative position within a range.

# Styling

The Text component can be styled using standard React Native styling properties through the mobile application's theme system. Unlike web components, mobile styling is applied through JavaScript objects rather than CSS classes.

Text input styling is typically configured through the application's theme settings, controlling properties like:

- Font family, size, and color
- Background color
- Border style, color, and width
- Padding and margins
- Placeholder text color
- Focus state appearance

For custom styling beyond theme defaults, you can create custom themes or override specific style properties through the application's styling system.

Consult the WaveMaker Mobile Theming documentation for specific details on customizing the appearance of Text and other input components in your mobile application.

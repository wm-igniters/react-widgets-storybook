# Styling

The FileUpload component can be styled using the following classes and properties:

| Class/Property | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| .app-file-upload | Main container class for the FileUpload component |
| .app-file-upload-button | Class for the upload button element |
| .app-file-upload-files | Container for the list of uploaded files |
| .app-file-upload-progress | Progress bar during file upload |
| .app-file-upload-clear | Clear button element |

You can customize the appearance by targeting these classes in your styles. The component also respects the following style properties:

- Height and width properties for controlling component dimensions
- Horizontal alignment for controlling content alignment
- Icon classes for customizing button icons

The component adapts to the application's theme automatically, including proper styling for light and dark modes.

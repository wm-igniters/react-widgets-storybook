# Styling

The Number widget can be styled using the theme customization options in WaveMaker Studio. The widget uses standard styling classes that can be customized according to your application's design requirements.

## Common Styling Classes

| .app-number | Applied to the main container of the Number widget |
| .app-number-input | Applied to the input element |
| .app-number-input-disabled | Applied when the Number widget is disabled |
| .app-number-input-readonly | Applied when the Number widget is read-only |
| .app-number-error | Applied when the input has validation errors |

Styling can be customized through the WaveMaker Theme editor or by adding custom styles to your application.

# Styling

The Datetime component does not have its own specific styles. It inherits styling from the individual **Date** and **Time** components it combines. To customize its appearance, apply styles to the Date and Time components individually.


<!-- # Styling

The Datetime component supports styling customization through various style properties and classes.

## Basic Styling

| Style Property | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| width | Controls the width of the component, can be specified in px or %. |
| height | Controls the height of the component. |
| margin | Sets the margin around the component. |
| padding | Sets the padding within the component. |

## Component-Specific Styling

| Class/Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Input field | Styling affects the text input area. |
| Date picker | Styling affects the calendar popup. |
| Time picker | Styling affects the time selection interface. |
| Buttons | Styling affects the increment/decrement buttons in the time picker. |

## Conditional Styling

The Datetime component has different visual states that can be styled:

- Default state
- Focused state
- Disabled state
- Read-only state
- Error state (validation errors)

### Example Styling Approaches

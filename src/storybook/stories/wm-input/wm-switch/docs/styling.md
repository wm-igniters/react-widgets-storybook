# Styling

The Switch widget supports styling customization through the application's theme system. In mobile applications, styling is primarily managed through the theme and style properties.

## Styling Options

- The appearance of the Switch widget is governed by the application's theme settings
- For custom styling, consider using a custom theme or style overrides
- The Switch adapts to different form factors and screen sizes automatically

## Best Practices

- Ensure sufficient touch target size for mobile usability (minimum 44x44 points)
- Maintain adequate spacing between switch options
- Use clear, concise option labels
- Consider using a consistent color scheme for different switch states
- Ensure proper contrast between the switch and background for accessibility

  <summary>Default Value</summary>
    <div>
        | Property | Type | Default | Description |

        | `datavalue` | - | - | This is the default value to display value for an editor component.

  <summary>Validation</summary>
    <div>
        | Property | Type | Default | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |

<details>
  <summary>Behavior</summary>
    <div>
        | Property | Type | Default | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `multiple` | boolean | false | Enable/Disable to switch between Multiple/Single select. |
        | `show` | boolean | true | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
        | `loadOnDemand` | boolean | false | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the component will be deferred till the component becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the component through script until the component is initialized). When show property is not bound the component will be initialized immediately. |
        | `disabled` | boolean | false | If the disabled property is true (checked) the component becomes display-only and user input will not be accepted. It can also set programmatically by binding it to a boolean type variable. |

# Overview

The Switch widget in a application provides users with the ability to toggle between multiple options with a single tap. Unlike a simple toggle switch that provides binary options (on/off), this component allows selection from three or more values, making it versatile for scenarios where users need to choose from multiple discrete options.

## Features
- Toggle between multiple predefined options
- Customizable dataset for populating switch options
- Support for both default and custom values
- Accessible interface with hint and tab index properties
- Flexible layout configuration
- Integration with form validation

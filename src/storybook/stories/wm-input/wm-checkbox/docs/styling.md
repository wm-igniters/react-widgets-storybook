# Styling

The Checkbox component supports styling through the application theme and style properties. Since this is a React Native component, styling is applied through style objects rather than CSS classes.

## Component Parts

The checkbox consists of the following styleable parts:

- Checkbox container - The outer container that holds both the checkbox and its label
- Checkbox indicator - The visual box that shows checked/unchecked state
- Checkbox label - The text caption next to the checkbox

## Styling Properties

| Style Property | Description |
|---|---|
| backgroundColor | Background color of the checkbox indicator |
| borderColor | Border color of the checkbox indicator |
| color | Color of the checkmark when checked |
| fontSize | Font size of the label text |
| fontWeight | Font weight of the label text |
| margin | Space around the checkbox component |
| padding | Inner spacing within the checkbox component |

## Theming

The checkbox respects the application theme settings for:

- Primary colors for checked state
- Text colors for labels
- Font family and size settings
- Disabled state styling

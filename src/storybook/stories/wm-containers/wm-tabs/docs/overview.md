# Overview

Tabs is a container component that organizes content into separate panes where only one pane is viewable at a time. It provides an easy and powerful mechanism to handle large amounts of content within a limited area, allowing users to quickly access different sections without leaving the page.

The Tabs component can be used in both static mode (with predefined panes) or dynamic mode (generating panes from a dataset), making it versatile for various application needs.

## Features

- **Configurable Tab Position**: Display tabs at the top, bottom, left, or right of the content

- **Tab Navigation**: Programmatically navigate between tabs
- **Transition Effects**: Apply animations like slide or fade when switching between tabs
- **Icon Support**: Add icons to tab headers with configurable positioning

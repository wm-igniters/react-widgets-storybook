# Callback Events

The Linear Layout component does not have any specific callback events. Standard DOM events like click, hover, etc. can be used as with any HTML element, but there are no specific programmatic events exposed in the component API.

You can still attach event listeners to the container or its children using JavaScript if needed for your application.

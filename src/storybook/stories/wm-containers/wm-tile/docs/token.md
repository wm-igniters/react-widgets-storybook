# Token Reference Table

This table lists all tokens for this component:

| Token | Description |
|-------|------------|
| padding | Controls the internal spacing inside tile components (rectangular content blocks that hold information). This creates breathing room around the tile content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-tile-padding |
| background | Sets the background color of tile components (rectangular content blocks that hold information). This is the main background color that appears behind the tile content.<br>CSS variable: --wm-tile-background |
| color | Sets the text color of tile components (the color of text content within rectangular content blocks). This should contrast well with the background color for readability.<br>CSS variable: --wm-tile-color |
| radius | Controls the corner rounding of tile components (rectangular content blocks). This makes the tiles appear with rounded corners instead of sharp edges for a softer appearance.<br>CSS variable: --wm-tile-radius |
| shadow | Controls the drop shadow effect around tile components (rectangular content blocks). This creates a subtle shadow that makes the tiles appear to float above the background, giving them depth and elevation.<br>CSS variable: --wm-tile-shadow |

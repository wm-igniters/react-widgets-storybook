# Styling

The Tile widget comes with pre-configured styling that gives it a distinct appearance from regular containers. You can customize the look and feel of the Tile through the application's styling system.

## Conditional Styling

You can use the Conditional Class property to apply specific styles based on conditions:

```javascript
// Example of setting a conditional class in script
Page.Widgets.myTile.conditionalclass = "highlighted-tile";
```

This allows you to dynamically change the tile's appearance based on data or user interactions.

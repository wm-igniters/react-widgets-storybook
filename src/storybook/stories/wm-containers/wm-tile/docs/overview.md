# Overview

The Tile is a container widget used to present a set of objects in a limited, stylized box format. Unlike other containers, Tile comes with default styling that makes it suitable for dashboard-like interfaces where you need to display analytical data or content in a grid-like arrangement.

Tiles are particularly effective for creating dashboard UIs that display analytics data, key metrics, or content summaries in a visually organized manner.

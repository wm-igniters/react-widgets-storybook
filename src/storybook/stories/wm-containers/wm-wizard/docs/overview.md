# Overview

The Wizard component is a container that guides users through a multi-step process in a structured manner. It breaks complex tasks into sequential steps, making the user experience more intuitive and manageable. The wizard provides navigation controls (next, previous, cancel, done) and visual indicators to help users track their progress through the workflow.

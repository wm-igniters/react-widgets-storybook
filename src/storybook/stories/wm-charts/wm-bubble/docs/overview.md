# Overview

The **Bubble Chart** component is a powerful visualization tool that displays data as bubbles. Each bubble’s position represents two variables (X and Y), while its size represents a third variable, allowing you to visualize relationships between three dimensions of data at once. Data can be bound from tables, variables, web services, live filters etc. This makes it ideal for spotting patterns, correlations, and trends in complex datasets.

# Overview

The **Bubble Chart** component is a powerful visualization tool that displays data as bubbles on a two-dimensional chart. Each bubble’s position represents two variables (X and Y), while its size represents a third variable, allowing you to visualize relationships between three dimensions of data at once. Data can be bound from tables, variables, web services, live filters etc. This makes it ideal for spotting patterns, correlations, and trends in complex datasets.

### Markup

```javascript
<wm-chart type="Bubble" title="Bubble Chart" height="250px" iconclass="wi wi-bubble-chart" name="bubbleChart"></wm-chart>
```

### Use Cases

- Compare multiple products by revenue (Y-axis), units sold (X-axis), and profit margin (bubble size).
- Track stock performance by price (X), volume (Y), and market capitalization (bubble size).
- Visualize patients by age (X), blood pressure (Y), and BMI or risk factor (bubble size).

# Styling

The Tree component does not expose any design tokens.

<!-- The Tree component can be styled using CSS classes. Here are the key classes that affect the appearance of the tree:

| CSS Class | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| .wm-tree | The main container of the tree component |
| .wm-tree-node | Applied to each node in the tree |
| .wm-tree-node-content | The container for node content (icon and label) |
| .wm-tree-node-icon | The icon element for each node |
| .wm-tree-node-label | The text label of each node |
| .wm-tree-node-selected | Applied to selected nodes |
| .wm-tree-node-expanded | Applied to expanded nodes |
| .wm-tree-node-collapsed | Applied to collapsed nodes |
| .wm-tree-node-loading | Applied to nodes in loading state |
| .wm-tree-children | Container for child nodes |

## Custom Styling Examples

```css
/* Customize the selected node appearance */
.wm-tree-node-selected > .wm-tree-node-content {
  background-color: #e6f7ff;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Style expanded node icons */
.wm-tree-node-expanded > .wm-tree-node-content .wm-tree-node-icon {
  color: #1890ff;
}

/* Add custom indent lines */
.wm-tree-children {
  border-left: 1px dashed #d9d9d9;
  margin-left: 12px;
  padding-left: 12px;
}
```

You can also apply conditional styling through the app-level CSS or through inline styles by accessing the component in your scripts. -->

# Overview

The Icon component is a versatile UI element that allows you to display graphical icons within your application. Icons enhance user experience by providing visual cues and making interfaces more intuitive. Many components like Panel, Button etc. have a way to display an icon. You can choose the icons from the list of `wavicon`, `font-awesome` or custom library.

### Markup

```javascript
<wm-icon name="icon" iconclass="wi wi-save" class="fa-xs" variant="default:xs"></wm-icon>
```

### Use Cases

- Use icons like edit, delete, or download to clearly represent actions without relying only on text.
- Show visual status indicators like success, warning, error, or loading using icons.
- Display icons in menus or sidebars (home, settings, profile) to help users navigate quickly.

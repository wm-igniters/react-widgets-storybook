# Styling

The button component provides a comprehensive set of CSS classes for visual customization and styling variations.

## Available CSS Classes

### Base Classes

- **`app-button`** - Default style class that provides the foundational button styling
- **`app-button-disabled`** - Applied to buttons in a disabled state, typically reducing opacity and preventing interactions

### Color Variants

- **`btn-default`** - Standard button appearance with default color scheme
- **`btn-primary`** - Primary action button with prominent styling, usually in the brand's main color
- **`btn-secondary`** - Secondary action button with subdued styling for less important actions
- **`btn-info`** - Information button, typically styled in blue tones to convey informational actions
- **`btn-success`** - Success button with green styling to indicate positive or confirmation actions
- **`btn-warning`** - Warning button with orange/yellow styling to indicate caution or important notices
- **`btn-danger`** - Danger button with red styling for destructive or critical actions
- **`btn-dark`** - Dark-themed button with dark background and light text
- **`btn-light`** - Light-themed button with light background and dark text

### Special Variants

- **`btn-link`** - Link-style button that appears as a text link without traditional button borders
- **`btn-only-label`** - Text-only button styling, minimal appearance focusing on the label content
- **`fab-btn`** - Floating action button styling, typically circular with prominent elevation
- **`mini-fab-btn`** - Smaller version of the floating action button for compact layouts

## Usage

Apply these classes directly to button elements to achieve the desired visual appearance. Classes can be combined for custom styling effects, though color variant classes should typically be used individually to avoid conflicts.

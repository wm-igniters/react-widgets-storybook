# Styling

The Anchor component can be styled using class-based styling in your application theme.

## Common Style Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.app-anchor` | Applied to all anchor components. Use for general anchor styling. |
| `.active` | Applied when the anchor is in an active state. |
| `.disabled` | Applied when the anchor is in a disabled state. |

Note: When an anchor is contained within other components like navigation bars, it may inherit additional styling from the parent container.

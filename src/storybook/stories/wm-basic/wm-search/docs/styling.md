# Styling

The Search component in React Native uses standard styling properties for customization. While the specific CSS classes aren't directly applicable as in web applications, you can customize the appearance through standard styling properties.

### Common Style Customizations

- **Width and Height**: Control the size of the search component
- **Picture Width**: Set the width of images displayed in search results

### Example Styling

```javascript
// These would be applied through styling properties
Page.Widgets.employeeSearch.pictureWidth = "24px";
Page.Widgets.employeeSearch.width = "100%";
Page.Widgets.employeeSearch.height = "48px";
```

For more advanced styling needs, you would typically need to customize at the theme level or through container styling properties.

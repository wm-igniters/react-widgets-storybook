# Methods

The Video widget can be accessed in script using the syntax: `Page.Widgets.videoWidgetName`

The current documentation does not specify custom methods for the Video widget. The widget likely relies on standard HTML5 video element methods, but these are not formally documented as part of the WaveMaker Video widget API.

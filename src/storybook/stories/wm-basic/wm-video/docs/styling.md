# Styling

The Video widget uses standard styling properties such as width and height for basic customization. Additional styling for the Video widget is not explicitly documented.

The appearance can be primarily controlled through the properties panel using the following options:

- Width and Height properties to control the dimensions
- Poster image to display before playback

Custom styling may be possible through the application's theme or by modifying the parent container of the Video widget.

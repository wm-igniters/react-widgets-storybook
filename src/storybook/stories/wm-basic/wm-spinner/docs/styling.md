# Styling

The Spinner component's appearance can be customized through its properties rather than direct styling. The primary visual aspects are controlled by:

- **iconClass**: Determines the icon displayed
- **iconSize**: Controls the size of the spinner
- **animation**: Sets the animation style

Custom styling beyond these properties would typically be handled through theme customization for the mobile application.

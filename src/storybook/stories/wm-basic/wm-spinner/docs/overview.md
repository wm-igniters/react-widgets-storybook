# Overview

The Spinner component provides visual feedback to users during time-consuming operations or background processes. It displays an animated loading indicator with optional text to inform users that content is loading or an action is being processed.

The Spinner is especially useful in mobile applications to indicate network requests, data processing, or any background task that requires users to wait, helping to improve the user experience by communicating that the application is working rather than frozen.

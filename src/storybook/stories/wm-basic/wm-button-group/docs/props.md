        | Property | Type | Default | Description |

        | `show` | boolean | true | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
        | `loadOnDemand` | boolean | false | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the component will be deferred till the component becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the component through script until the component is initialized). When show property is not bound the component will be initialized immediately. |

# Styling

The Picture widget inherits styling properties from the mobile framework. Since the Picture widget is a basic component, styling is primarily controlled through its built-in properties like shape, aspect, width, and height.

For advanced styling, you can set the following properties:

- **width/height**: Control the dimensions of the picture container
- **shape**: Apply predefined styling (rounded, circle, or thumbnail)

When using shape properties:
- **rounded**: Applies rounded corners to the image
- **circle**: Makes the image appear in a perfect circle (best with square images)
- **thumbnail**: Applies a thumbnail style with a border and slight padding

# Overview

The Progress Circle widget visually represents the completion status of a process or task using a circular progress indicator. It provides a clear visual cue of progress by displaying a proportional filled arc and corresponding percentage or value within a circular container.

This component is particularly useful for displaying progress in a compact and visually appealing manner, especially in space-constrained mobile interfaces. The progress can represent anything from file uploads to task completion, data loading, or any other process that occurs over time.

# Overview

An inline frame (**Iframe**) is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. Frames allow a visual HTML Browser window to be split into segments, each of which can show a different document. The iframe element represents a nested browsing context.

### Markup

```javascript
<wm-iframe name="iframe" iframesrc="https://www.wavemaker.com/"></wm-iframe>
```

### Use Cases

- Embed external websites or pages such as documentation, marketing pages, or partner portals without leaving the app.
- Integrate third-party tools like payment gateways, maps, analytics dashboards, or support systems.

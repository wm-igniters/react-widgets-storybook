# Styling

The Message widget's appearance is primarily controlled through its type property, which applies appropriate styling based on the message type (error, warning, success, info, loading).

- Error messages typically use red coloring with an error icon
- Warning messages typically use yellow/orange coloring with a warning icon
- Success messages typically use green coloring with a checkmark icon
- Info messages typically use blue coloring with an information icon
- Loading messages typically display with a loading spinner

Additional styling can be customized through the standard layout properties (width, height) and animation property.

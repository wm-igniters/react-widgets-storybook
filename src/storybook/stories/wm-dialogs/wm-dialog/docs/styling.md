# Styling

The Design Dialog component supports customization through various layout and appearance properties. While specific CSS classes are not explicitly defined in the documentation, you can control the visual presentation through the component props.

## Key styling options:

- **Dimensions**: Control the dialog size using width and height properties
- **Header**: Toggle header visibility with the showHeader property
- **Icon Customization**: Modify the icon appearance using iconClass, iconWidth, iconHeight, and iconMargin
- **Animation**: Apply custom animations for dialog transitions

For more advanced styling, you can customize the dialog content by adding and styling child components within the dialog container.

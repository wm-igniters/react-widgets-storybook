# Styling

The page-dialog component likely inherits styling options from the base dialog components. While no specific CSS classes are documented for this component, you can use standard dialog styling techniques to customize its appearance.

Consider applying custom styles to:

- Dialog container
- Dialog header
- Dialog content area
- Dialog footer and buttons

Note that when using prefabs, the styling may need to be applied to the prefab template itself rather than directly to the dialog component.

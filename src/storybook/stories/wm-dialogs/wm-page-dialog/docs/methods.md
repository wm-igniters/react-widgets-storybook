# Methods

The page-dialog component can be accessed via scripting using the standard widget reference syntax:

```javascript
Page.Widgets.myPageDialog
```

However, the page-dialog component does not expose any specific methods. Interaction with the component would typically be through manipulating its props or through the content displayed within the dialog.

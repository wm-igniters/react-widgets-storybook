# Callback Events

The Carousel component does not have any documented callback events. However, standard DOM events can be attached to the component as needed for specific implementations, such as:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| onClick | Can be added to handle click interactions with the carousel |
| onMouseEnter | Can be used to pause automatic rotation when the user hovers over the carousel |
| onMouseLeave | Can be used to resume automatic rotation when the user's cursor leaves the carousel |
